                    Many regions offer incentives for solar energy use.
                    Check out this <a href="https://sunroof.withgoogle.com/">calculator</a> to estimate your savings.
                    Even in places without incentives, like Georgia, you can sell excess power back to the power companies.
                    Depending on your electricity usage, solar energy can help you save or even earn money each month.

                    Using green energy helps the environment.
                    Substituting fossil fuels for solar energy helps reduce the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
                    This helps reduce the effects of climate change.
                    Using solar not only helps the environment, but it also helps you!
                    In the US, there is over 1,650 million metric tons of CO2 released into the atmosphere every year.
                    With solar, you can help reduce that number.
